            <h5>Pruning Instructions</h5>
            <p>
                Proper pruning requires an understanding of the plant's growth pattern. Plants grow from the tip down,
                meaning new growth emerges from the dominant bud at the end of a branch or stem.

                To prune a plant to encourage bushy new growth, snip off the dominant buds on select stems, staggering
                the cuts to encourage varied growth. Trim some branches back by a quarter, others by a half, and still
                others all the way back to their base. This way, when the plant leafs out again, the random growth
                pattern will fill it out.

                Deadheading is a type of pruning that simply involves removing any dead flowers. As a plant blooms, it
                puts energy into its flowers at the expense of new growth. Even as a flower is dying, it still consumes
                energy from the plant. So to prolong the blooming period and encourage healthy growth, deadheading is
                often necessary.

                Any cut made to a plant's tissue can expose it to disease. So keep your pruning instruments sharp, and
                clean and disinfect them between each use with a mild bleach-and-water solution.

            <h5>Rotate Instructions</h5>
            <p>
                Just like humans, plants have good and bad sides! Unlike us, plants need to show both on an equal basis
                for balanced growth. And if you’ve ever seen a heavily leaning indoor plant, you can bet it wasn’t
                getting a regular rotation.

                So why is it a good idea to rotate indoor plants? Unlike the sun, which moves across the sky throughout
                the day, windows and artificial light limit the amount of light exposure our plants are getting, and
                where they’re getting it. And because all plants grow towards the light, this can often lead to uneven
                growth patterns. Rotating them essentially ensures that our plants are getting an even amount of light,
                reducing the lean and also promoting new growth in areas that might otherwise stagnate.

                So how often should you rotate your indoor plants? For plants that prefer lots of light, rotating them
                once every few months. For a plant placed in a medium to low light area, you may need to rotate them
                more often, up to once every few weeks or once a month.
